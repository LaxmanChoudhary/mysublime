`to make sublime go super-saiyan`<br>
The guide here is to be followed by who has just shifted to **light-weight** sublime-text3 and want to make their experience good enough as if he is using an IDE. Usually a programmer, developer or a learner shift to a light-weight editor when his device specs are not upto the mark to withstand the resources pressure by VS Code, intellijIDE, pycharm or any of those bulky code editors / IDE.<br>
Sublime Text 3 is a partially free code, which means they will always remind you to purchase the licence, which in fact might be really good to support the developers of this great editor. It is a really great editor which if configured well with right plugins and settings, then it can workk well as a IDE.<br>

### Definitely follow the guide if you are new to it or even if not, but want to configure your sublime to unlock its full potential.
