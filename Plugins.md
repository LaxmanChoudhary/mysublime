# `Base`
To start with, first we have to install **package control** using `ctrl + shift + p`, typing package control might give us the optin to *install package control*<br>
Once installed package control you will have access to all the packages/plugins to enhance our sublime-text 3.<br>
We still might not want to use these packages as raw and would modify them to our taste. Once all plugins are downloaded we can head to `sublime-settings` sub-repo to edit the configurations.<br>
To start installing of package, use `ctrl + shift + p` for command pallete and type install package which would give you option like **Package Control: Install package**, clicking on it will bring you the list of all available packages available on package control to be installed.<br>

# Must have sublime packages
## For full-stack web developers

First thing first, being a python lover I would recommend the first package as,
- **`Anaconda`**<br>
Provides python autocompletions, linting, definitions and many more awesome features. The official documentation can be easily found by a google search.<br>
 - **`sublimeCodeIntel`**(optional)<br>
CodeIntel provides autocomplete features same as anaconda, so there's a choice to make between going anaconda or sublimeCodeIntel. As codeIntel needs extra preparations to work, I might consider anaconda as a starter which we could switch if want to.<br>
Needs binary installation as well (via python `pip install -U CodeIntel`).
- **`A File icon`**<br>
It shows little favicons to the files in the sidebar as per their format for better visuals. You would surely love it.<br>
- **`SideBarEnhancement`**<br>
Provide with handful options to work with on our files directly from sidebar.
- **`AutoFileName`**<br>
Help with path to files in your project, provides autocompletions to locate your file. Try it by tring to type path to a file you want to use in a project.<br>
- **`AllAutoComplete`**<br>
Helps in autompletion from various open files.<br>
- **`Emmet`**<br>
A very well known toolkit package among web developers.<br>
- **`Bootstrap 4x AutoComplete`**<br>
For bootstrap lover, provides autocompletions to bootstrap classes.<br>
- **`JsPrettier`**<br>
For formating of your code. It is a plugin for using prettier library from npm.<br>
##### Requires installing of prettier library
`npm install prettier`<br>
`yarn add prettier`<br>
- **`GitGutter`**<br>
To see git diff in gutter. A helpful tool when using Git version control.<br>
- **`Markdown Preview`**<br>
To preview markdown(.md) files in browser.<br>

### `stack dependent`
These package entirely depend on your development tools you use, if you are a MERN, Python developer or so.<br>

#### `Django`<br>

- **`Djaneiro`**<br>
Django support for Sublime 2/3

#### `ReactJs`<br>

- **`Babel`**<br>
Syntax definitions for ES6 JavaScript and React JSX extensions.

For themes and color ui, you can go to package control website to check out available themes and colors before installing.<br>
Below I have mentioned some of my favourites.<br>
- **Theme** - Flatland<br>
- **Theme** - SoDaReloaded<br>
