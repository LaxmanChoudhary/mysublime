# `Base`
To start with, first we have to install **package control** using `ctrl + shift + p`, typing package control might give us the optin to *install package control*<br>
Once installed package control you will have access to all the packages/plugins to enhance our sublime-text 3.<br>
We still might not want to use these packages as raw and would modify them to our taste. Once all plugins are downloaded we can head to `sublime-settings` sub-repo to edit the configurations.<br>
To start installing of package, use `ctrl + shift + p` for command pallete and type install package which would give you option like **Package Control: Install package**, clicking on it will bring you the list of all available packages available on package control to be installed.<br>

## Must have sublime plugins
###  For full-stack web developers

First thing first, being a python lover I would recommend the first package as,
- **`Anaconda`**
Provides python autocompletions, linting, definitions and many more awesome features. The official documentation can be easily found by a google search.
 - **`sublimeCodeIntel`**(optional) (via python `pip install -U CodeIntel`)
 CodeIntel provides autocomplete features same as anaconda, so there's a choice to make between going anaconda or sublimeCodeIntel. As codeIntel needs extra preparations to work, I might consider anaconda as a starter which we could switch if want to.<br>
